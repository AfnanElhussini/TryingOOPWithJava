# OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMING:
<b> Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model (methodology or Paradigm) that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. 
An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.</b>

## **Java** is a class-based, Object-Oiented Programming language.

## Objects
are the things you think about first in designing
- Data, Properties, Attributes
- Operations(), Methods(), Functions().
An instance of an excecutable copy of a class.
Another name for instance is object.

## Class
is a template, Prototype, blueprint for objects, and an object is instance of a class.

## Access Level Modifiers
- Public (accessible from any class).
- Private (accessible withn the class where defined)
- Protected
- Defult or Package-Private (when no access specifier is specified)
